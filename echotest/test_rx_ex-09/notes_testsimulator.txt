The simulation created using https://zipcpu.com/tutorial/lsn-09-serialrx.pdf
and the scala file "https://github.com/develone/SpinalTemplateSbt/blob/master/src/main/scala/mylib/UartCtrlGenerics.scala
privided by PasCal++@volatile-static on "https://gitter.im/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL"
Creating a simulation to test UartCtrlUsageExample.v using ZipCPU ex-09-uartrx.tgz
This simulation uses rxuart_tb.cpp, testb.h, uartsim.h, uartsim.cpp.  The Verilog
rxuart.v and f_txuart.v.  
The file psalm.txt is sent to rxuart module during the simulation.

|  The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.                                  |
|  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still  |
|    waters.                                                                   |
|  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his   |
|    name's sake.
|  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear   |
|    no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.     |
|  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou      |
|    anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.                          |
|  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I    |
|    will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.                             |
|                                                                              |

step1
UartCtrlUsageExample.v was copied to rxuart.v.  The module UartCtrlUsageExample
replace module rxuart.
Made modoficatation rxuart.v, testb.h, rxuart_tb.cpp
make 
./rxuart_tb psalm.txt

Need to increase the Verilog Baud rate to match the simulator.
