Creating a simulation to test UartCtrlUsageExample.v using ZipCPU ex-09-uartrx.tgz
This simulation uses rxuart_tb.cpp, testb.h, uartsim.h, uartsim.cpp.  The Verilog
rxuart.v and f_txuart.v.  
The file psalm.txt is sent to rxuart module during the simulation.

|  The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.                                  |
|  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still  |
|    waters.                                                                   |
|  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his   |
|    name's sake.
|  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear   |
|    no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.     |
|  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou      |
|    anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.                          |
|  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I    |
|    will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.                             |
|                                                                              |
